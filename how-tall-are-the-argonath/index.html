Some quick calculations make goliath’s height, according to the mt, to be about 8 feet 9 inches (8.875), and according to 4 qsam (a) and the lxx to be about 6 feet 1 inch. In the kjv (and other versions) the height of goliath is given as “6 cubits and a span” which is around 9 foot and 9 inches. I got these heights off the premise that aang is 4 ft.</p>
