<p>Recommendations of the amount and types of exercise are published frequently. Personally, if you put your true effort into your cardio, then 20 minutes is a good amount of time to have in it. You workout for one minute with strenuous activity and push your heart rate to about 90 percent of its maximum rate. If you want to improve endurance, do long, low intensity cardio.</p>
